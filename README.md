# Sales-Forecast
Sales Forecasting Program
Overview
This Python program is designed for sales forecasting using machine learning, specifically implementing linear regression. The program takes advantage of a provided dataset to train the model and make predictions for future sales based on the learned patterns.

Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn

Prepare your dataset:

Ensure your dataset is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, Excel).
Make sure the dataset includes columns for relevant features (independent variables) and the target variable (sales).
Update the configuration:

Open the config.py file and modify the variables according to your dataset.
Train the model:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
This command will load the dataset, preprocess it, train the linear regression model, and save the trained model to a file.

Make predictions:

bash
Copy code
python predict_sales.py
This command will use the trained model to make predictions on future sales based on the provided dataset.

Configuration
DATA_FILE: Path to your dataset file.
FEATURES: List of features (independent variables) used for training the model.
TARGET: Target variable (dependent variable) to predict.
TEST_SIZE: Percentage of the dataset used for testing during model training.
